For getting started with Java, BlueJ is a good choice. 
For more serious work, though, you will want:

* Developer's IDE such as Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJ IDEA
* Java JDK installed separately (not the one in BlueJ or Netbeans)
* Java documentation
* The Java Tutorial from Oracle

## 1. Java Development Kit

Java programmers should stick with a Long Term Support (LTS) version
of Java, not necessarily the latest Java.  
Currently there are 2 LTS versions:

* Java 8 - has all features needed in this course and includes JavaFX
* Java 11 - uses Java module system. Does not include JavaFX (install JavaFX separately).


1. [Java Development Kit 11][] (LTS).  We will use Java version 11 because it is the current "long term support" release.  Java version 8 is also fine, but it does not have the `jshell` interactive Java interpretter -- not a big deal since you can do the same thing in BlueJ.
    * [Download Java 11][Java Development Kit 11]
    * Where to install? (a) a directory with **no space in the path**, (b) **short path** is better, (c) not on the Desktop.

## 2. Java Documentation

The Java API documentation should be installed on your computer and *bookmarked* in your web browser. This is a great source of knowledge.  

* The [Java 8 Docs][] are *easier to read and browse*, so install them.
* The [Java 11 Docs][] include some new classes, so install that if you use Java 11. 

> If you don't install it, you will not be able to look-up the Java API during a quiz or exam.

    * [Java 11 Online Docs][]

**The Java Tutorials**

The official Java Tutorials from Oracle haive lots of examples and are a good way to learn Java.

* [Download Java Tutorial Bundle](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html)
* [Online Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
* [Really Big Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html) for finding things
* [W3Schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/default.asp) another good tutorial. Simpler and shorter than Oracle's tutorials.

> Some of the best SKE Java programmers say that the only Java "book" they studies from was the Java Tutorial.

## Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Java

For beginners [BlueJ][] is great.  Simple interface and interactive "codepad" where you can use Java interactively.

Eclipse, Netbeans, or IntelliJ are preferred for serious development.  All these IDE support Java and many other languages (including Python and Kotlin).  

* [Eclipse][] versatile free IDE.  Configuring it is a bit complex.
* [IntelliJ IDEA][] has free community and "edu" editions.  This is same IDE as PyCharm with different configuration.  Configuring IDEA is also a bit complex.
    * The Edu edition includes EduTools plugin.  You can add this plugin to any version of IDEA, including PyCharm.
    * [IntelliJ Edu for Java][] includes a plugin for interactive courses in the IDE.
* [Netbeans][] is easiest to learn of these 3 IDE and has excellent curated plugin system.  Refactoring is somewhat less powerful than Eclipse or IDEA.

You can also write Java using VS Code, but the tools are much less powerful than the above 3.

## Required Book

Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E.  Covers Java 7. The 4th edition can also be used; its almost identical and more concise but some section numbers differ.

We'll describe you how to get the book in class.

### Windows Users: Where to Install Java

* Install Java using a short directory path **without any spaces** in the path.
* Don't install Java or JDK docs on the desktop.
* Use a **short path** without any **space** in the name.
```
Good path: C:\java\jdk8u151 
Bad path:  C:\Program Files\Java\JavaSDK 8u151
Also bad:  C:\Users\admin\Local Files\Desktop\Eclipse
```

If you install Java software in a long path with spaces it is difficult to correctly add it to the PATH variable that is used in command windows.  It also makes it harder for you to find!

## Recommended

1. BlueJ IDE from [https://bluej.org](https://bluej.org) . In BlueJ you can visualize code, interactively type and run code (without compiling), and inspect objects.
2. [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) from Oracle is great help learning how to do things in Java. There is a [download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) on the page to download it.  The "Really Big Index" page is the most efficient way to find things in the material, so bookmark it.
3. UML editor for drawing Class and Sequence diagrams.  There are UML extensions for Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ.  [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor I use in class. It doesn't draw Sequence Diagrams well, though.

## Suggested Books

* *Head First Java*, 2E. Entertaining, visual, and very memorable, but long.
* Wampler, *The Essence of Object-Oriented Programming with Java* (2001). Old, but really good explanation of O-O concepts.
* *Starting Out with Java*, 5E by Tony Gaddis.  Covers the same material as *Big Java* but more focused presentation. Also covers JavaFX.
* David Eck, *Introduction to Programming in Java* free online and downloadable PDF at [http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/).  Good but too long.  Prof. Eck has other free books you may like.
* Horstmann, *Object-Oriented Design and Patterns*, 2E (2006). Condensed from "Big Java" with more emphasis on OO concepts and design.  Many SKE graduates say this is the **best book**.  OOP students can borrow my copy.
* Horstmann, *Core Java for the Impatient*. Same material as the famous *Core Java* series, but more concise and more example code.
