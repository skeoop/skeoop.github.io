title: Graphics in Java using Swing
---

Java has several frameworks or toolkits for creating graphical user interfaces,
graphical animations, and other graphics apps.  There are also some high
equality open-source frameworks such as 3D-Monkey.

Oracle recommends using JavaFX for graphical applications,
which is newer and actively developed (but Oracle spun it off
to an open-source project managed by Gluon).

The material below describes how to create a GUI using Swing,
the predessor to JavaFX, that is still supported and
included in the JDK and JRE.
