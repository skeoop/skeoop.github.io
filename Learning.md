### Java Tutorials

[The Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/index.html) a very extensive collection of tutorials covering the Java language.
 * [Download](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) the full tutorial and run on your computer, for easy access.
 * The *Really Big Index* is best place to find things. Bookmark it.

[W3Schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp) many short sections, with interactive code examples you can run in the browser window. This tutorial has less reading than Oracle's Java Tutorial.

### Online Courses

[Complete Java Developer Course][] on [Udemy][] is highly-rated, in-depth course that covers Java and OOP. Looks like the best Udemy Java course but not free. Savle Price 300 Bt.
 * [Udemy][] has many Java courses, including some free ones.

[Coursera][] has some series courses using Java.  Interesting ones are:    
 * [Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](duke-oop-java) 4-course series (Duke University), first one is:
 * [Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software][duke-java-programming] (Duke University)
   - has online resources page http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/index.php
   - uses BlueJ, Apache CSV, other open source
   - interesting projects

*Java Programming Fundamentals* by Galileo University on [edX](https://edx.org) is a good course.

[Microsoft Java Courses on edX][]. Microsoft Java courses on edX are OK but don't cover much:    
  * Learn to Program in Java
  * Object-Oriented Programming in Java.
  * Data Structures

[Java Code Geeks][] a lot of Java learning material, some very advanced.  Not a good place to start learning Java, but useful when you want to know something in depth.

[Codecademy Learn Java][] partially free course covers Java basics. Has a nice interactive coding editor where you can enter Java code and have it evaluated.

[Hyperskill.org](https://hyperskill.org) by IntelliJ has interactive Java lessons and programming problems, rated by difficulty.  Some interesting problems:
 * Smart Calculator (medium)
 * Linear Equation Solver (medium)
 * Readability (hard)
 * Blockchain (very hard)
 * Contacts (hard)

### Books

**Required:**
*Big Java* by Cay Horstmann. Easy to read book by professor who has written many Java books, including *Core Java*.  Sixth edition includes Java 8 streams, lambdas, and other features, but Fifth edition is OK for this course.

**Recommended:**
*Object-oriented Design and Patterns*, 2E by Cay Horstmann.    
[Chapter 1](docs/OODP-Chapter1.pdf) is a *Crash Course in Java*. If you learn to code quickly, this is great.

[Think Java][] free online and downloadable book. Covers basic Java syntax, not much OO or advanced features. Many code examples.

*Core Java for the Impatient* by Cay Horstmann.  More concise book on Java for people who know basic programming. Covers only the Java language, not O-O or programming concepts.  Useful as reference.

*Modern Java in Action*, 2E.  Covers newer and more advanced Java features.  Another great book, part of Manning's *In Action* series.


### Not so Good

[Learn Java Online](https://learnjavaonline.org) collection of Java tutorials, with interactive exercises. Some exercises look tedious and not very good code.

Interactive Java course in IntelliJ.  The course is repetitive and boring, spends too much time on trivial tasks.
