**Password Encrypting** you should *never* store passwords as plain text, for security. Encrypt passwords!

* When the user sets a new password you encrypt it using a *one-way hash*.  The result is a String such as "$a4$10$rb85CdE5982VrAZ873". Store the encrypted string (instead of the original password).
* Each time the user enters his password you encrypt it (again) using the same algorithm, and compare it with the original encrypted string. If the encrypted Strings match, the passwords match.   
* A popular, easy-to-use library for this is [jBCrypt](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/).   
There is a [JBCrypt Demo Project](https://github.com/jbrucker/jbcrypt-demo) showing how to use JBCrypt.
[Excellent explanation in Pawan's OOP2017 project docs](https://github.com/guitarpawat/course-feedback/blob/master/README.md). You should write documentation like this!
