### Optional: Databases with JDBC and ORM

We didn't have time to cover this. Its not core to OOP and some
students have already learned it on their own.
Since databases are a common part of apps, you might want to
know some of the basic concepts.

Fundamentals:

* Some common databases, including client-server and embedded.
* Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) used to identify resources such as databases
* Simple SQL queries and commands.
* The 4 basic operations: create, retreive, update, and delete (CRUD)

Java Howto:

* Using JDBC to access a database
* Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to save and retrieve objects in a database. Many apps are simpler if let an ORM framework do the work for you, instead of using JDBC yourself.  EBean and ORMLite are easy to use. 
* For Java, the Java Persistence API (JPA) is the standard. EclipseLink is the reference JPA implementation. We won't cover JPA, but EBean uses much of the JPA API.
* Design: separate persistence from other classes in your app. Defining Data Access Objects (DAO) is one common design.

## First Half of the Course

## [Week 1](https://www.github.com/skeoop/skeoop.github.io/week1)

0. Preliminaries.
	* Introduction to course.   
	* Requirements. Also on [About the course](About) page.
1. Review of Java basics  
    * Ex - Java exercise
    * Ex - Java naming convention. *Identify types of names.*
2. Java coding standard and Javadoc.
    * How to use the Java API docs (Javadoc).
    * Ex - fix the code (in lab)
3. Introduction to object and classes. A conceptual interpretation of objects.
    * Three characteristics of objects.
    * Example and exercise
    * Why program with objects?
    * The problems of software design and development.
    * O-O fundamentals and the "3 pillars" of O-O paradigm.
    * Polymorphism: Why can we "print" any object? How does Java handle this?
    * Encapsulation and access control: public, protected, private.
    * Inheritance.
    * Ex - use encapsulation to change implementation of Matrix or Classroom (OOP1).
4. Object References.  
    * A reference is *not* an object.
    * A useful analogy: reference is like a "remote control" for an object.  The buttons are the object's methods.  This helps explain how polymorphism works.


### Assignment 1. Do this before lab tomorrow.

1. Install the command line `git` on your computer, from https://git-scm.com/download/. (Windows, MacOS X, or Linux)
2. After you install `git`, you should set your name and email. Execute these commands (with your name and email):
     ```
     cmd> git config --global user.name "Fatalai Jon"
     cmd> git config --global user.email fatalai.j@ku.th
     ```  
3. Create an account on Github.
4. Edit your Github profile and include:
    * your *real name*, in English with correct capitalization.
    * a photo that clearly shows your face.  
5. (Helpful) Read a Git tutorial of your own choice.  [Try Git](https://try.github.io/) lets you try git in your browser and contains more than you need to know.
6. [Git Cheat Sheet (PDF)](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) has summary of useful commands.


#### Lab 1

There are 2 parts to the lab. The files are in the week1 folder.

1. [Lab1-1-Git.md](https://skeoop.github.io/week1/Lab1-1-Git.md) practice using git.
2. [Lab1-3-Guessing-Game](https://skeoop.github.io/week1/Lab1-3-Guessing-Game.pdf) write a Guessing Game in Java.  See the PDF for instructions.
    * In Lab: commit source code for a game that works, and README.md file.
    * "push" a copy of your repo to your Gtihub account as `GuessingGame` repo
3. Due Tomorrow (Saturday):
    * write good Javadoc for classes and methods. Use `@param`, `@return`, `@author` tags.
    * fix any problems with your code.
    * format code to be easy to read.

2. Interfaces in Java. One of key ways to enable polymorphism.
3. Designing with Interfaces.  Factoring out common behavior.
4. UML Class Diagram.
    * How to show attributes, methods, visibility, static, and constants.
    * How to show interfaces and "implements".
    * How to show relationships: *dependency*, *association*, *inheritance*.

#### Lab 2 DUE TO HOLIDAY, LAB ATTENDANCE IS *OPTIONAL*. YOU CAN DO THIS LAB AT HOME.
