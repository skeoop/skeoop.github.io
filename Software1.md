## 1. Github Account with Profile

1. Create a Github account, if you don't already have one.  
  * Suggest you choose a Github ID that is *not too long*. Many people use their name or some abbreviation of their name, in lowercase or TitleCase.
      - Example [contributors to Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/graphs/contributors) on Github 
2. Complete your Github account **profile**.  You should include *at least*:
  * Your **real name in English** with correct capitalization. OK to use just first name, or first and last name.
  * A **photo** that clearly shows your face. Face should be at least 40% of vertical size.
3. Enter your Github ID in this form: 
[https://goo.gl/forms/uJU4wOJl0CJsJYhf1](https://goo.gl/forms/uJU4wOJl0CJsJYhf1).    
4. Check your e-mail for an invitation to join "OOP2020" on Github, and accept the invitation.
5. After you join "OOP2020" on Github, you are also added to the Github classroom for the course.
    * This is different from "Google Classroom"

## 2. Join Google Classroom

We will use Google Classroom for some assignments. 

Goto [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) and use class code **umaxt4s** to join.

## 3. Install Git Command Line Client

We will use Git for assignments.  The git command line tool is best for
learning git.
You can also use Git tools integrated into an IDE, but the command line is still needed when something goes wrong. 

Download from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)

## 4. BlueJ IDE

You can use any IDE you like for programming, but to get started in Java please try the BlueJ Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  Its easy to use so you can concentrate on Java instead of learning the IDE. BlueJ has some useful tools for exploring objects.

* [Download BlueJ](https://bluej.org) from https://bluej.org.

For MacOS and Windows, BlueJ includes the Java Development Kit (JDK).  You don't need to install a separate JDK (for now).

Version to use:
    - **BlueJ 4.2.2** requires **Java 11**
    - **BlueJ 4.1.4** requires **Java 8** or newer

Linux Users:

You should install either Java 11 or Java 8, since these are "Long Term Support"
releases.  Java 8 has all the features we need and somewhat simpler to use.

For Linux, download and install the JDK from either of these:
    - [Adopt OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net), or
    - [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    - Choose the correct JDK version for BlueJ: either JDK 8 or JDK 11 

Both OpenJDK and Oracle Java SE JDK are functionally identical, but the license is different.    

OpenJDK gives you a choice of Java Virtual Machine (JVM):
    - HotSpot JVM (same as Oracle JDK) has better CPU performance (about 18%)
    - Eclipse OpenJ9 has fast startup and much lower memory usage

## Required Book

Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E or newer.  

We'll describe you how to get the book in class.

For the new features in Java 8 you need the 6th edition, but for everything else the 5th edition is OK.

## Recommended Reference

[The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) from Oracle is great help learning how to do things in Java. There is a [download link](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) on the page to download it.  
  * The "Really Big Index" page is the most efficient way to find things in the material, so bookmark it.

[Java Tutorial on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/JAVA/default.asp) is more concise and has many code examples.

## Suggested Books

* *Head First Java*, 2E. Entertaining, visual, and very memorable, but long.
* *Modern Java in Action*, 2E (2019). A very good book includes lambdas, streams, and reactive programming.  Part of the Manning "*In Action*" series.
* [Introduction to Programming in Java][eck-java] by David Eck, free online books covers Java and JavaFX. Updated regularly.
* Horstmann, *Object-Oriented Design and Patterns*, 2E (2006). Condensed from "Big Java" with more emphasis on OO concepts and design.  Many SKE graduates say this is the **best book**.  OOP students can borrow my copy.
* Wampler, *The Essence of Object-Oriented Programming with Java* (2001). Old, but very good explanation of O-O concepts.
